# Personal Website - Version 1

This website is personal project where the purpose is to learn as much as I can about React, HTML, Javascript. Trying to implement stuffs that I've learnt throughout my work projects and as well learn more about UI/UX stuffs. 

# Getting Started

- `npm install`
- `npm run start` to start the dev environment
- `npm run build` for production build

# More about this project

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
